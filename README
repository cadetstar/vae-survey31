Todo:
Modify README to serve as an actual README for IT staff

==README==

The VAE Survey site v3.1 should operate much faster than the previous version.  This readme will cover
    some basic information about the application itself, the technologies in use and some basic maintenance information.

===Technology===

Ruby v1.9.2
Rails v3.1.1
thin (webserver)

Run "bundle show" in D:\vae-survey31 for a full list of all gems in use.

===Maintenance===

Common Tasks:
    1. Restart the server workers
    2. Restart the background workers
    3. Clear the background queue

==== Restart the server workers ====

To restart the server workers, you should open up a command prompt to D:\vae-survey31.  Once there, run user-restart.bat to perform a slow restart of all four workers.

==== Restart the background workers ====

If they background worker has died for some reason, run the "spawn_bg_worker" Scheduled Task to start it back up.

==== Clear the background queue ====

If the background queue has become backed up for some reason (this is the queue that processes reports), run 'RAILS_ENV=production rake jobs:clear
 from D:\vae-survey31.  This will erase all in process reports.
